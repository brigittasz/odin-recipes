        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The dish we call lasagna has been called, for most of its existence, and in most parts of the world, lasagne. Lasagna is singular, and lasagne is plural. The exact etymology of the word is unclear, but it has referred to a wide sheet of pasta that is placed in a pot with food served on top of it for a very long time. The first reference to it in the Oxford English Dictionary is from the 18th Century, and that’s just to its appearance in print in English. There are references to words very similar to lasagne in Greek and Latin, as a scholarly article describes here.

            English poet Robert Browning wrote about the dish in “The Englishman In Italy” in 1844:
            
            “We shall feast our grape-gleaners (two dozen, Three over one plate) With lasagne so tempting to swallow In slippery ropes,”</p>
